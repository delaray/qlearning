# Q-Learning

A basic implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm in  Clojure. This code was initiall written for a presentation given at LispNYC several years ago.

[Reinforcement Learning and Neural Nets](https://www.slideshare.net/delaray/reinforcement-learning-and-artificial-neural-nets)

It has been updated for a simple Clojure and Reinforcement Learning workshop.

## Clojure Setup

[Setting up Clojure, Leiningen and Cursive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lp0_vJ5VzjH66LjxRxo_p8hRhQJ4jXE9lfftpqpbZmU/edit#heading=h.syzuknz0oqm8)


## Demo

Once you have succesfully installed Leiningen, you can simple run the demo examples by typing the following in the project root directory. The parameter n should be a number between 1 and 4 inclusive.

    lein run n
